  <p>Enough! JavaScript had us in its grip for long with its foot guns. The first time I heard the term <em>Hoisting</em>, I had no idea about it and misheard as <em>hosting</em>. You declare variables using <em>var</em> happily, and you have to come to peace with yourself that it is okay to <em>hoist</em> the <code>var</code>s (lift&rsquo;em all to the top-most scope). I can&rsquo;t believe JS convinced the rest of us that it was okay. Then came ES6 and saved us. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let"><code>let</code></a> fixed the scoping. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const"><code>const</code></a> provided immutability. At least now, you can say JavaScript supports functional programming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JavaScript got feathers on its hat - <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even a kid would tell you that the top 2 facets of functional programming are immutability and functions as first-class citizens viz. Higher Order Functions (<em>HOF</em>). The other facets are equally important but without the top two, there is no functional programming.</p>
<p>From day one, C# has supported the ability to treat functions as first-class citizens through <code>delegate</code>s. Yes, the concept of <em>HOF</em> wasn&rsquo;t at its best in C# until the introduction of anonymous delegates or better <a href="">lambda</a>s later. But, hey, you were able to pass functions around as data.</p>
<p>That was one side of the coin - <em>HOF</em>. What about the other side - immutability? As you should know by now, <a href="https://vivekragunathan.wordpress.com/2017/12/06/facets-of-immutability/"><strong>Immutability</strong></a> is not a light subject.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a shame that even after 15+ years, C# doesn&rsquo;t yet support immutability &hellip; <strong>fully</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>C# supports (compile-time) constants (<code>const</code>), and a partial or rather peculiar support for immutable variables (<code>readonly</code>). With <code>readonly</code>, you can only declare immutable <em>member</em> variables. It cannot be used with local variables or method parameters. But here&rsquo;s the peculiar part.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <code>readonly</code> is still mutable within the constructor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder why.</p>
<p><strong>Selling Immutability</strong></p>
<p>I am a big fan of <a href="https://vivekragunathan.wordpress.com/2017/12/06/facets-of-immutability/">immutability</a>. The confidence that an immutable variable provides is irreplacable. Once you start declaring immutable variables - assignable only once, the complexity of your code / logic untangles and assembles itself in steps. Individual steps of your logic wire smoothly in a chain / pipeline allowing each step to be tested independently.</p>
<p><strong>Immutability for C#</strong></p>
<p>I have not read (any) proposals myself but heard rumors, once or twice, of adding support for immutable variables in C#. Like I said, I haven&rsquo;t looked into the proposals, so I am dreaming here.</p>
<p>There are several ways to get C# support immutable variables.</p>
<p><strong>New Keywords/Quantifiers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>val</code></strong></p>
<p>&hellip; as in Scala or pairing up with C#&rsquo;s own <code>var</code>.</p>
<p>Despite being succinct and using an establish convention, I don&rsquo;t like this option because of two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>var</code> was invented primarily for automatic type deduction or what C# calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/implicitly-typed-local-variables">implicit typing</a> specifically for LINQ queries that return anonymous types. Although the C# team was smart in making it more or less general purpose, it might have been better named <code>auto</code>. Since C# is not a purely functional language and is inherently imperative, it just so happens that <code>var</code> naturally got related to (mutable) variable.</li>
<li><code>var</code> is restricted to local variables. It cannot be used as class members, method parameters etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should <code>var</code> be lifted outside function scope to class members and others so that <code>val</code> becomes an apt counterpart? In other words, <code>var</code> and <code>val</code> should be freely usable - local variables, members arguments etc. That won&rsquo;t work because <code>var</code> on parameters does not make sense (an indication that <code>var</code> is <code>auto</code>) and <code>val</code> on class members overlaps with <code>readonly</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>var</code> is not lifted, yeah maybe, <code>val</code> might work. Or maybe, not quite so. For instance, if we assign a LINQ query returning an anonymous type to a <code>val</code>, we would expect <code>val</code> to perform automatic type deduction. Although it is nice, <code>val</code> now is doing more than what we started with viz. immutable variables.</p>
<p>Over the recent years, C# has been trying to appeal to the Java and JavaScript community more than its patrons. A <code>val</code> would appear to be an effort to appeal to the Scala community.</p>
<p>Like I said, <code>var</code> and <code>val</code> pair up verbally but not in their purpose. There is definitely some noise around there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>immutable</code></strong></p>
<p>&hellip; in parlance with F#&rsquo;s <code>mutable</code>.</p>
<p>Of all the ways to declare variables, mutable and immutable, I like the F#&rsquo;s most; better than Scala&rsquo;s <code>var</code> and <code>val</code>. Like Scala, while F# supports mutable variables, you are required to specify it explicitly using the <code>mutable</code> keyword. But the beauty of F# is having to decorate the default <code>let</code> with <code>mutable</code> making it stand out visually.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">// F# code

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Borrowing the idea, we could come up with an <code>immutable</code> keyword.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">// C# code</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">mutCount</span>          <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">GetNoOfItems</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">immutable</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">imCount</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">GetNoOfItems</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Does the job. Besides being mouthful, what do we with <code>readonly</code>? Two different keywords for essentially the same thing. This will be a catalyst for introducing yet another for immutable method parameters. Come on, this isn&rsquo;t PHP 😂.</p>
<p>If thrown for a vote, I am sure this option would lose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reuse Existing Keywords/Quantifiers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>const</code></strong></p>
<p>A vehement <em>No</em>. A constant is <a href="https://vivekragunathan.wordpress.com/2017/12/06/facets-of-immutability/">different</a> from an immutable variable. Any attempt to reuse will skew the meaning of existing conventions in C#. Case closed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>let</code></strong></p>
<p>Mixed feelings. <code>let</code> was schooled for LINQ queries. Although the (intermediary) variables declared through <code>let</code> are immutable[^1], it is not particularly obvious in an imperative language like C#. A <code>let</code> in C# does not suggest the same thing as in F#.</p>
<p>Suppose we go with <code>let</code>, do we make it an independent keyword or a modifier on existing variable declarations?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">// C# code</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">immutableCount</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">GetNoOfItems</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>or</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">// C# code</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">imCount</span>	<span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">GetNoOfItems</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I prefer the latter because the former is on the same boat as <code>val</code> and implicit typing thing we discussed earlier. The latter seems to fit the bill. Just that <code>let</code> has got this unintended feel of a lame copy from F# and poorly applied. Do we really want that blame?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>readonly</code></strong></p>
<p>If done right, this would be the perfect choice. Before dealing with the <em>perfect</em> side of it &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scope wise, <code>readonly</code> is the opposite of <code>var</code>. A <code>var</code> is stuck inside methods while <code>readonly</code> is stuck outside. Oh, lovers apart! Earlier we discussed about lifting <code>var</code> outside the function scope. Here, we like to get <code>readonly</code> into function scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>var</code> is the equivalent of the actual type specifier (or the type auto-detected). <code>readonly</code> is a modifier on a type specifier. So, <code>readonly</code> goes well with <code>var</code> too. <em>Lovers meet</em>. So, <code>readonly var imCount = …</code> is as legit as <code>readonly int imCount = ...</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>readonly</code> is equivalent of F#&rsquo;s <code>mutable</code> producing the reverse effect. A <code>readonly</code> in C# makes a variable immutable while <code>mutable</code> does the opposite in F#. Both are modifiers on variable declarations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, shall we declare <code>readonly</code> the winner? Yes, but not quite. It is not a perfect choice yet. Because let us remind ourselves that <code>readonly</code> is a peculiar one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If we make one breaking change of no longer supporting <code>readonly</code> member variables mutable inside a constructor then <code>readonly</code> should be the perfect choice.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will argue that mutated <code>readonly</code> member variables today can be rewritten to once-assigned and truly immutable variables. So, a breaking change here is truly for the win.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other side of the fence</strong></p>
<p>Languages that started out as functional first like Scala, F# and others are well-off; as far as immutability is concerned. On some level, I would say C++ too has got it covered; nevertheless beware of quirks.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be exaggerating to say that JavaScript has by far the largest community behind it; the support of which blessed it with <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.</p>
<p>Let us take a moment to interrogate the arch rivals we created - C# and Java.</p>
<p>Java started out with support for immutability but not <em>HOF</em>; until the introduction of lambdas in version 8. So now, you can do functional programming in Java; or so they say.</p>
<p>On the other hand, C# started out with (a little crude) support for <em>HOF</em> and is still limping its way towards supporting immutability. No wonder, they are arch rivals. What an odd world we live in.</p>
<hr>
<p>Needless to say, there should be other good options. Love to hear.</p>
<p>C# is a very carefully designed language. There is abundant written material to prove that. At the same time, it is man-made. So any limitations or shortcomings one should see should be seen with some love.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that each language starts out with a certain flavor - imperative, OO, functional or whatever, and later finds itself struggling or unable to support other flavors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>reasonable</em> language should support and allow picking from a variety of widely practiced paradigms, techniques and styles of programming and yield to the <em>reasonable</em> programmer to implement a solution that fits the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or so did <em>Bjarne Stroustoup</em> say (something similar), of course quoting C++. He was right in every way.</p>
