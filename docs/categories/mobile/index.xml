      <title>The Windows Phone Epic !!!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be overwhelmed at the length of the article. I have tried my best to keep the length of the article not directly proportional to the time required to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oscar Wilde said, &lt;em&gt;If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they’ll kill you&lt;/em&gt;. There are times when truth tends to be subjective, such as this article. However, I have definitely added the fun component to keep up earlier promise. Consider the time you spent reading this article as a break from your work or routine. I am sure you will enjoy it; doesn’t matter if you are using a Windows Phone 1. Perhaps you will read it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am programmer[^2], gadget savvy, an avid fan of Microsoft products (especially Visual Studio and associated suite of development tools), and an honest critic of any product I use. I have an Android Phone, an iPhone, and for a few months now, a Windows Phone. And this is my experience with the Windows Phone – good, bad and grey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, the Windows Phone landscape (app and feature set) is dry and unpromising. There are a few good things here and there to console ourselves for the money we spent on the phone, and for the love of Microsoft!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I gave SMS FireWall a refresh with a couple of features requested by users:-   An option &amp;#8216;Allow and Move&amp;#8217; in the settings screen, which when checked moves the messages from the quarantine vault when opted to be added to the allowed list.</description>
