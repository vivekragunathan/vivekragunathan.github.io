      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was about a decade ago when &lt;a href=&#34;https://us.amazon.com/Microsoft-Visual-Studio-NET-Professional/dp/B00005RV4Z&#34;&gt;Visual Studio .NET 2002&lt;/a&gt; was launched. Having worked with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Visual-Studio-Professional-6-0/dp/B00003W8H8&#34;&gt;Visual Studio 6&lt;/a&gt; until then, the new interface was refreshing and powerful along with .NET and the suite of languages, tools and technologies. If you were there, you would have felt &lt;em&gt;times were changing&lt;/em&gt;. Beyond the cool and modern interface, Visual Studio &lt;strong&gt;.NET&lt;/strong&gt; 2002 had a lot more to offer  compared to Visual Studio 6 — .NET. It was an exciting time for me back then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
