<p style='font-family:Open Sans;'>
  I have been using Android for quite some time now, and only recently I noticed that Android pops up a notification <i>reminding you of a reminder</i>. It says &#8220;Upcoming alarm &#8211; Buy Milk&#8221;, where Buy Milk is the reminder I had set.
</p>

Is it smart enough to help a lazy volatile minded guy like me or is it trying to be my wife who would not rest until I buy milk? Don&#8217;t know.
