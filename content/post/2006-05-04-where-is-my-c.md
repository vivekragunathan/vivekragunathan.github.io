I have been using C# for quite some time now, and that too VS 2005. I see that Programming Pain at a macro level has boiled down to thinking than coding. Though it might be an advantage on one side, I feel I have become lazy. Since I am a programmer from the C++ world, it was very easy to become lazy. The small and handy applications that I write for myself in C++, I am writing them in C#. Even now I am a great disciple of C++. And even though C++/CLI is out there, and I work a small amount of it in my project, I am getting inclined to C#.

I am not sure why I am writing this.  
Is it the fear or sorrow of getting away from C++ ?  
Or am I just expecting much elegant syntax and features like in C# ?

But I have begun to feel that the result you achieve out of the code you write is much more important than the programming language you use. Does anyone care whether Windows or Visual Studio or Yahoo Messenger or Google Talk or Internet Explorer or FireFox or any application you love, is written in C++ or C# or C++/CLI ? That is the way I consoled myself.

But I wish that C++ never go exile in my programming life.
