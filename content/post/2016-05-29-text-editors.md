I am not a *nix commands expert .. but a [professional][1]? So why not relish educating my brother a couple of nifty commands, especially &#8211; `find` and `grep`, which he was looking into at the time. You can find a few more [here][2] if you are interested.

<!--more-->

So much for the command line, watch out for the \_overdose\_<sup id="fnref-1559-1"><a href="#fn-1559-1">1</a></sup>. I find it funny when people, especially developers, copy files on the command line on a Mac (or Ubuntu for that matter); I mean files on the local machine. Specifically, they either copy the file (`Cmd-C`) via the Finder and paste it, or worse drag and drop, on the Terminal <sup id="fnref-1559-2"><a href="#fn-1559-2">2</a></sup>. Our next laugh was about editing local files in `vim` 😆<sup id="fnref-1559-3"><a href="#fn-1559-3">3</a></sup>.

> The question isn&#8217;t why shouldn&#8217;t you edit local files in `vim` 💪, the question is why would you (want to)? 🤔 

I told my brother I will send him a list of all the text editors that he should install on his machine. Each editor has its own flavor, purpose, particularly _power_. For instance, the find & replace in TextMate is unparalleled. Each editor also has its own limitations albeit its powers.

Personally, I use every one of them including `vim`; one that favors the situation or my mood 😇.

So without further ado &#8230;.

  BTW, I don&#8217;t hate command line. I just don&#8217;t like the idea that using it for everything makes you geeky.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1559-1">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id="fn-1559-2">
  If you haven&#8217;t seen anybody around you copying or editing files on the command line, I envy you. You are lucky. Or are you the one copying/editing on the command line? 😆&#160;<a href="#fnref-1559-2">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id="fn-1559-3">
  I wouldn&#8217;t waste time engaging in the debate that <code>vim</code> and <code>emacs</code> are the powerful editors and only those with brains can use it.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1559-3">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id="fn-1559-4">
  Not sure if it can be configured via keyboard shortcuts.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1559-4">&#8617;</a> </fn></footnotes>
