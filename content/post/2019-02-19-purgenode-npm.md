If you haven't found a use for this script that uninstalls the second largest junk in the world next to Mac/iOS updates, you are either lazy or scared of breaking things.  I am neither, so I polished this [script](https://gist.github.com/VivekRagunathan/15c8b3b408c8015683a8d5fcf97cbf2f) from the different versions you will find on the internet. Oh, I am talking about node/npm.

Happy cleaning!
