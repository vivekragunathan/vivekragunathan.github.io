A long time back, in one of my posts [here][1], I had discussed about [Extension Methods][2] … in C++; sorta! It seems that the grand daddy, [Bjarne Stroustoup][3], had read my post, and was impressed. So he has published a paper – [Call syntax: x.f(y) vs. f(x,y)][4]. Good thing except I don’t like the idea of assuming x.f(y) for f(x, y) while the reverse is the actual idea of extension methods. You will know when you read his paper. It seems the commander, [Herb Sutter][5], also was impressed with my post. Not only that he too doesn’t seem to like the x.f(y) for f(x, y) idea. Great men think alike. LOL! So he published his paper – [Unified Syntax][6]. How is that?

Needless to say, I was _completely_ kidding about the Herb and Bjarne about borrowing the idea of extension methods from my post. I wasn’t even born when Bjarne invented C++. The papers are deep in considering various scenarios from a language standard perspective unlike my post where I just spotted the possibility of the feature.

While C++ produces awesome languages with superior and modern syntax, constructs and concepts, it takes a long time to do that for itself. That is a sad thing! Nevertheless, I love C++ and am fortunate to have programmed in it.
