Earlier this year, I [wrote][1] about [publishing][2] C++/CLI Primer on [LeanPub.com][3]. I wondered if there is anybody else besides myself and Microsoft using C++/CLI but readers surprised and humbled me with their support. Seems C++/CLI is here to stay. Know why?

A couple of months back [Apress][4] Publications took notice of the book and offered to publish/print. So here it is: **C++/CLI Primer for .NET Development**, my first book; who would&#8217;ve thought ðŸ˜Ž

  * On [Amazon][5]
  * On [Apress][6]

I don&#8217;t see this publication as a great achievement or something for there are &#8220;miles to go &#8230; miles to go&#8221;. But it is a little thing to celebrate; cute moments of life.

In penning down the book I was just the vehicle. Friends and family are the wheels and fuel of the vehicle.

Thanks to Apress &#8211; Steve, Mark, Amrita and the team.

Thanks to my wife and my brother who always supported and encouraged me to write.

Thanks to [Sanjeev][7] and [Sammy][8] for not letting my fire within die.

Finally, also taking liberty on behalf of Sanjeev: Special thanks to [Tom Craig][9] for without his guidance _we wouldn&#8217;t have known what makes programming a joy_.
