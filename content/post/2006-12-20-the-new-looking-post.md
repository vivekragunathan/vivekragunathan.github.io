  <span style="font-size:100%;">I am very much fond of tools, updates and stuff. So I keep updating my softwares and hear/learn about new tools etc. I am excited about the new spaces &#8211; Live Spaces. Looks much better than before. I thought I would write something about the new spaces. Please &#8216;spaces guys&#8217;, make the arranging the boxes on the home page a bit easier and intelligent. That is a feature request. Otherwise the default skin/theme is cool and professional. Old themes are still old and not much appealing. Anyway, i write the post just to say i love it.</p>

    And talking about tools and softwares, i heard this news about Microsoft acquiring the <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/">SysInternals</a> tools. And probably, Microsoft might be shipping the tools like <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/utilities/debugview.html">Debug View</a>, <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/utilities/processexplorer.html">Process Explorer</a>, <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/utilities/regmon.html">RegMon</a> etc with the Windows SDK. Me not sure of that, better <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomarcher/archive/2006/07/18/669894.aspx">read</a> what Tom Archer said.</span></div>
