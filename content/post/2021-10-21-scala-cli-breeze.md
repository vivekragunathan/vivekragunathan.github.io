When I first [read](https://twitter.com/krever01/status/1451064263892668418?s=21) about [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/), I wasn't quite sure of the motivation while you have the Scala REPL itself, sbt console, ammonite etc.

I took **`scala-cli`** for a ride. My first impressions, if I have to put it one line:

> One thing that stood out to me is the simplicity.

`scala-cli` is very approachable. Generally speaking, the command line options are the first line of discouragement for any command line tool. It is a relief that `scala-cli` kept the list of options extremely simple and intuitive yet powerful.

While scripting in Scala is available in many flavors elsewhere (ammonite, IntelliJ worksheet etc.), it is a no-brainer in `scala-cli`. Especially with the shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env scala-cli`), it is as simple as it can get.

In the process of learning the commands, I distilled this cheatsheet (mostly for myself). It is not extensive but a 10-min quick start guide. I will update the cheatsheet as I learn more.
