Tired of prank SMSes. Need a simple way to block them, and keep your inbox clean? Don’t worry. You got it!

[SMS Firewall](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.vivekr.smsfirewall) is a simple and cute (hope you like it!) Android application to block and quarantine unwanted SMS from reaching your inbox. Unwanted are those who are neither in your contacts list nor in the allowed list, which is provided by the application. Phone numbers or sender names such as your bank or mobile service provider can be added to the allowed list. You got an option to either notify you of the blocked SMS or ignore it, in which case you will have check the quarantine vault by yourself. Besides, you have a ‘Just Monitor’ mode, which is primarily used for debugging purposes or when you don’t want to block SMS from unknown sender(s) (for a while). When this mode is switched on, SMS from unknown senders will reach the inbox and also a copy of it is saved in the quarantine vault.

You can download the latest version of the [application](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.vivekr.smsfirewall) from the Android market. Give it a try and let me know how you like it (rate it!). I hope it proves to be of use to you in keeping your inbox clean.
