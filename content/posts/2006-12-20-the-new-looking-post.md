I am very much fond of tools, updates and stuff. So I keep updating my softwares and hear/learn about new tools etc. I am excited about the new spaces - Live Spaces. Looks much better than before. I thought I would write something about the new spaces. Please _spaces guys_, make the arranging the boxes on the home page a bit easier and intelligent. That is a feature request. Otherwise the default skin/theme is cool and professional. Old themes are still old and not much appealing. Anyway, i write the post just to say i love it.

And talking about tools and softwares, I heard this news about Microsoft acquiring the [SysInternals](https://www.sysinternals.com/) tools. And probably, Microsoft might be shipping the tools like [Debug View](http://www.sysinternals.com/utilities/debugview.html), [Process Explorer](http://www.sysinternals.com/utilities/processexplorer.html), [RegMon](http://www.sysinternals.com/utilities/regmon.html) etc., with the Windows SDK. I am not entirely sure of that. But check out what Tom Archer [said](http://blogs.msdn.com/tomarcher/archive/2006/07/18/669894.aspx).
