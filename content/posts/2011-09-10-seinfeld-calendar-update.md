We have released an update for [Seinfeld Calendar](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.pongal.seinfeld) with a bunch of some exciting features and defect fixes. I hope they are exciting for you too.


- **NOTES**: You can add notes or additional information for a task on a month basis. Again, the notes are maintained month wise and not date wise. It is just to keep it simple, since adding it date wise would require a special selection mechanism for marking a date as completed.
- **REMINDERS**: When you create a new task or edit an existing task, you will now be able to add reminders for a task, or disable them too if you added one already. As you might have guessed it, the reminder pops up a notification at the specified time reminding you to do the task. It could be jogging in the morning or taking your pills at night. The tool is now improved to not only keep track of your task status, but also helps you to do it everyday by reminding you. So you will not miss doing it!
- **HOME SCREEN WIDGET**: We have added the facility to drop home screen widgets on your home screen _per task_. The home screen will show you the current date and you can click the date to mark it done. If you click the task name, it will take you to the specific task\current month in the application.

So with the above features, doing the task and tracking it has become super easy. Despite all the handy features, it is all in your hands to do your task. It is just not about marking it done.

However, we did a grave mistake. We lost the upload\upgrade key for the [original Seinfeld Calendar](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.pongal.seinfeld), which you guys would have already installed on your phones. So this update had to be released as a separate application, which sadly means you can not directly upgrade your application from the Android Market. Sorry folks, very foolish of us to lose the key. We renamed the old one as _Ex-Seinfeld Calendar_, which will remain as such for the rest of its days.

You can find the new application in its latest version [here](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.pongal.paid.seinfeld) or visit the market on your Android phone and search for Seinfeld Calendar.

Thanks to the users who emailed us their comments sharing their opinion and requesting improvements such as the above.
