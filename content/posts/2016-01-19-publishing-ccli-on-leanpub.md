I came across LeanPub [^1] a few months back. I believe it was through hanselman[^2] – blog, video or something. I liked LeanPub _instantly_ because of a couple of reasons.

  * It supports writing in markdown[^3] and I love markdown.
  * There is a large collection and variety of books including technical books and material, some of which are free too.
  * In case you are not a professional writer, the publication process encourages you with the feeling as if you are one.

I hadn’t written/published any lengthy material in a long time except the C+/CLI Primer on CodeProject[^4]. Why not publish same, I thought, and actually published[^5]. I wasn’t even expecting any response from anyone since the material was on C++/CLI, a language that gave me the impression that I was the only one using it at the time I published on CodeProject. 😀 I am really impressed that the material topped more than 50 downloads in about three months since it was published. **Heck, a couple of them even paid** despite the fact that the material is free. Not only am I humbled by this encouraging gesture but I am also convinced that C++/CLI is still being pursued and will continue to live – production, academic or as a pet language. Go grab your copy of the booklet – C++/CLI Primer. It’s free!
