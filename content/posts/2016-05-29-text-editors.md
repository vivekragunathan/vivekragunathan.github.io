I am not a \*nix commands expert … but a [professional](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2014/10/18/experts-vs-professionals/)? So why not relish educating my brother a couple of nifty commands, especially – `find` and `grep`, which he was looking into at the time. You can find a few more [here](/pages/cmd-line-quickies) if you are interested.

So much for the command line, watch out for the [overdose](/posts/text-editors-rundown/#fn-1559-1)[^1]. I find it funny when people, especially developers, copy files on the command line on a Mac (or Ubuntu for that matter); I mean files on the local machine. Specifically, they either copy the file (`Cmd-C`) via the Finder and paste it, or worse drag and drop, on the Terminal [^2](/posts/text-editors-rundown/#fn-1559-2). Our next laugh is about editing local files in `vim` 😆[^3].

> The question isn’t why shouldn’t you edit local files in `vim` 💪, the question is why would you (want to)? 🤔

I told my brother I will send him a list of all the text editors that he should install on his machine. Each editor has its own flavor, purpose, particularly *power*. For instance, the find & replace in TextMate is unparalleled. Each editor also has its own limitations albeit its powers.

Personally, I use every one of them including `vim`; one that favors the situation or my mood 😇.

So without further ado ….

## Markdown Editors

- Online
  - https://markable.in/
  - http://dillinger.io/
  - https://stackedit.io/

If you haven’t realized, text editing is a fundamental part of using a computer, especially if you are a programmer. Make sure you have options!

[^1]: BTW, I don’t hate command line. I just don’t like the idea that using it for everything makes you geeky.

[^2]: If you haven’t seen anybody around you copying or editing files on the command line, I envy you. You are lucky. Or are you the one copying/editing on the command line? 😆

[^3]: I wouldn’t waste time engaging in the debate that `vim` and `emacs` are the powerful editors and only those with brains can use it.

[^4]: Not sure if it can be configured via keyboard shortcuts.
