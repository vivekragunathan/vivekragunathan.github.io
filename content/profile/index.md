**FORTE**

  * Have extensive experience in architecting, re-architecting, designing and implementing large-scale backend/web applications
  * Eloquent and skillful in _functional_ and object-oriented programming, design and methodologies.
  * Dogmatic about producing highly reusable semantically meaningful space-efficient debuggable and maintainable quality code. To crash is a shame!
  * Have extensive experience in refactoring beyond-repair production code and transforming it into robust secure testable high quality code with no new defects and agreed breaking changes
  * Agnostic, interested and hungry to work with any present day language/technology.
    * Language agnostic, polyglot, linguist, linguaphile - Scala, C#, Java, C++, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Go
    * Prudent enough to employ the power of the language/technology to effectively solve business problems – Not do C programming with C++
  * Have extensive experience working in small and large teams practicing Agile software development with XP (eXtreme Programming) and TDD; project inceptions, story creations and estimations.
  * Adaptive to delivery-centric or research/innovation centric work style
