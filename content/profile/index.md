**FORTE**

- Extensive experience in architecting, re-architecting, designing and implementing large-scale backend/web applications
- Eloquent and skillful in functional and object-oriented programming, design and methodologies.
- Resolute in producing highly reusable semantically meaningful space-efficient debuggable and maintainable quality code. To crash is a shame!
- Language agnostic, polyglot, linguist, linguaphile - Scala, Java, C#, Go, Python, Rust, C++, TypeScript. Prudent enough to employ the power of the language/technology to solve business problems effectively.
- Extensive experience in refactoring beyond-repair production code and transforming it into robust secure testable high quality code with no new defects and agreed breaking changes
- Conceive, Propose, Document, Maintain and Adapt engineering standards and policies for efficient functioning of team and the product. The what and how matters, the why gives meaning.
- Self-driven in sharing knowledge and mentoring engineers to build and sustain the best-in-class team. Be the brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction.
- Open-minded and receptive to alternative viewpoints to find the most constructive path forward. Team work makes dream work possible.
- Have extensive experience working collaboratively in small and large teams practicing Agile software development.
